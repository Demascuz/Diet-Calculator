# Diet Monitor

## About the project

Personally, I find it very hard to keep track of all the foods and their nutrition values, I always have to google for 
the specific food's nutrition facts and then manually enter it in the Excel file. And then the next day I would forget 
the food's values, and would have to repeat the process again. The online applications which calculate food's 
nutrition values are wrong most of the time or offer no customizability.  

The **Diet Monitor** tracks the user's protein, carbohydrate, fats and calorie 
intake. The user will add the food that they have consumed every day and the application
will match the typed food with the pre-existing database and automatically add all the protein, fats 
and carbs to the daily diet calculator. This application is for people who are into fitness or 
just conscious about their diet and want to track their macros.
